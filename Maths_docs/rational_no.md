# Rational Numbers

## First types of numbers

<h3>
Whole Numbers
</h3>
Whole numbers are a set of numbers that includes all the natural numbers (positive integers) along with zero. In mathematical terms, the set of whole numbers is represented as:


**Starting from**

![Zero to](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7buceWnERhgk3gfS/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611ii9fqht0eekdag0geoxcqpo40rnq23v39ka7q9tl&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

**To**

Whole numbers start from zero and continue indefinitely in the positive direction. They do not include any negative numbers or fractions. Essentially, whole numbers are the numbers you use when counting objects and include zero as well.


 **Means**

 ```
 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 to ♾️

 ```

 <h3>Natural Numbers</h3>

 Numbers same as whole numbers but they dont have 0

 like:
 ```
 1,2,3,4,5,6 to ♾️
 ```

 <h3>Integers</h3>

 Integers same bit more confusing because they also goes in negative means from -♾️ to ♾️ with 0 this is a confusing statement but it is easier when you want to understand what a negative numbers

 for example
 ```
 -♾️ , -6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,♾️
 ```
 like this

 THis is a **Number Line**

 <h3>then ofcourse Rational numbers</h3>

 rational numbers are numbers with fractions like 1/2 -1/2 but the one main thing is rational number doesn't consist p = 0 for like 1/0 because we can't divide zero 0/1 is a rational number but p/0 is not a rational number 

I know you hate fractions

 but we had to study fractions because this chaper name is rational number

 ## Most important thing (Properties)

 <h3>Closure Property</h3>

 The easiest property the closure property means if a set of numbers,integers,rational is vise - versa so did it gives a same answer

 take it easy i had a simple example of it

 ```
 there is a set of number
 3 + 4, gives number 7
 if we opposite the number i means
 4 + 3, it will gives a same number 7

 it means the CLOSURE property is true in addition of a number
 ```
 Just look your book same things are given but in confusing way

 **WE JUST HAVE TO CHECK IF THE CLOSURE PROPERTIES ARE APPLIED IN WHAT CONDITIONS**

 let's begain

 **First i will check simple numbers**
Yes if solution is same and nope if answer is different
 | Operation | Equation | Is Closure Applied |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Addition   | 4+5=9 , 5+4=9   | yes   |
| Subtraction   | 10-5=5 , 5-10=-5 | Nope   |
| Multiply | 10x5=50 , 5x10=50 | yes |
| Divison  | 10÷5=10/5 , 5÷10=5/10 | Nope |

**Then on Integers**

| Operation | Equation | Is Closure Applied |
| --------------| -----------| -------------|
| Addition | -6+5=-1 , 5+(-6)=-1 | Yes |
| Subtraction | 7-5=2 , 5-7=-2 | Nope |
| Multiply | 7x5=35 , 5x7=35 | Yes |

**For Rational Numbers:**

| Operation   | Equation         | Is Closure Applied? |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Addition    | $$  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3}  = \frac{7}{6}  $$ | Yes                 |
| Addition    |$$ \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{6} $$ |                  |
| Subtraction | $$ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{10} $$ | Yes                 |
| Subtraction | $$ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{5} = -\frac{3}{10} $$ |                  |
| Multiplication | $$ \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $$ | Yes             |
| Multiplication | $$ \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{2} $$ |              |
| Division    | $$ \frac{5}{6} \div \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{4} $$ | No                  |
| Division    | $$ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{5}{6} = \frac{4}{5} $$  |                   |
