# Flowcharts: A Visual Guide to Algorithms

## What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a graphical representation of an algorithm. It's like a map that guides us through a series of steps to solve a problem. Programmers use flowcharts to plan, design, and communicate the logic of a program. Imagine it as a visual recipe for creating software!

## Basic Symbols in Flowcharts:

### Start/End Symbol
<p>The terminator symbol marks the starting or ending point of the system. It usually contains the word "Start" or "End."</p>

### Action or Process Symbol
<p>A box can represent a single step ("add two cups of flour"), or an entire sub-process ("make bread") within a larger process.</p>

### Document Symbol
<p>A printed document or report.</p>

### Multiple Documents Symbol
<p>Represents multiple documents in the process</p>

### Decision Symbol
<p>A decision or branching point. Lines representing different decisions emerge from different points of the diamond.</p>

### Input/Output Symbol
<p>Represents material or information entering or leaving the system, such as customer order (input) or a product (output).</p>


1. **Terminal (Oval)**: Represents the start, stop, or halt points in a program's logic flow. It's where the journey begins and ends.


2. **Input/Output (Parallelogram)**: Denotes any function related to input or output. Think of it as the gateway for data coming in or going out.

3. **Processing (Box)**: This symbol represents arithmetic instructions or actions. It's where calculations happenâ€”like adding, subtracting, or multiplying.

4. **Decision (Diamond)**: Indicates a decision point. It's like a fork in the road where you choose different paths based on conditions (yes/no or true/false).

5. **Connectors (Circle)**: Used when flowcharts become complex or span multiple pages.
