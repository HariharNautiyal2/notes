# MS MakeCode Arcade Games

MS MakeCode Arcade is a web-based platform that lets you create and play retro arcade games using blocks or JavaScript. You can also share your games with others and learn from the tutorials and examples. Here are some sample games that you can try out or modify:

## Very Simple Tetris Clone

This is a very simple Tetris clone that uses only four blocks and one button. The goal is to stack the blocks as high as possible without reaching the top of the screen. You can rotate the blocks by pressing the A button and move them left or right by tilting the device. The game gets faster as you score more points.

## Dino Run

This is a side-scrolling runner game where you control a dinosaur that has to save the dino babies from the meteor shower. You can jump over obstacles and enemies by pressing the A button and duck under them by pressing the B button. You can also collect eggs and power-ups along the way.
